# ESP32 Examples

Welcome to the **ESP32 Examples** repository! This repo contains a collection of example codes I use to test and experiment with ESP32 development. The examples are tailored for learning, debugging, and exploring the capabilities of the ESP32 platform.

## Features
- **Testing Various Functionalities:** Each example focuses on specific features or functionalities of the ESP32, such as GPIO, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ADC, PWM, and more.
- **PlatformIO:** All codes are developed and managed using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fareezmurad/esp32-examples.git
   ```
2. Open the folder in your favorite editor (e.g., VS Code).
3. Build and upload the examples to your ESP32 board using PlatformIO.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- Each example resides in its own folder.
- Example folder names describe the functionality being tested.

## Requirements
- ESP32 development board.
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of ESP32 development and C++.
